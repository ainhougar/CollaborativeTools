## Step by Step for Deployment
### ✅ Prerequisites

- A [**shinyapps.io account**](https://www.shinyapps.io)
    
- The **Shiny app** ready (e.g., `app.R`, or `ui.R` and `server.R`)

### 🔧 Step 1: Install required packages

In your R console:

`install.packages("shiny") install.packages("rsconnect")`

### 🔑 Step 2: Authenticate with shinyapps.io

1. Go to [https://www.shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io)
    
2. Sign in and click your **name → Tokens**
    
3. Click **"Show Token"** and copy the code.
    

In RStudio, paste the whole line into your console. It will look like this:

`rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='yourname',                           token='abc123',                           secret='xyz456')`


### 📁 Step 3: Open your app project

- Open the folder in RStudio containing `app.R`
- Or a folder with both `ui.R` and `server.R`

### 🌍 Step 4: Deploy the app

In R console:

`library(rsconnect) rsconnect::deployApp('path/to/your/app')`

Or, use the RStudio **GUI**:

- Click **"Publish"** in the top-right corner of the RStudio script editor

### ✅ Done!

Once deployed, RStudio will return a URL like:

`https://yourname.shinyapps.io/your-app/`

## Overwriting an existing app

rsconnect::deployApp(
  appDir = "path/to/new/folder",
  appName = "existing-app-name"
)


## Specificities of shinyapps.io

The **free tier** of [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) limits you to **5 applications**, with **only 3 active at a time**.

## Storage space in Shiny 

- **ShinyApps.io** has **500MB (or more)** of storage per deployed app depending on your plan.
    
- Your entire bundle is **under 1MB**, so you are using **<1% of your quota**.
    
- This means:
    
    - Fast upload and deployment
        
    - Fast load time for users
        
    - Minimal memory footprint


# Problems with Deployment

A plain **“500 Internal Server Error”** with no extra log info on shinyapps.io can be frustrating but it usually means the app is crashing right at startup or not launching properly. Here’s a focused plan to dig deeper and fix it:

---

## Why no detailed logs?

- Sometimes logs don’t show up if the app **fails before Shiny server fully initializes**.
    
- Common causes: missing packages, startup errors in `global.R` or `app.R`, or file-loading issues.
    
- Or the error happens so early that logs don’t get captured properly.
    


## Common Causes of Stalling at “Starting instances”

### 1. **App crashes on startup**

If your app fails to launch (due to bad file, code error, memory overflow), shinyapps.io retries the instance behind the scenes — it can silently stall here for several minutes.

✅ **Fix**: Add diagnostic messages in `app.R` or `global.R` like:

r

CopyEdit

`print("Reached start of app")`

And deploy again — check if that message appears in the logs afterward.

---

### 2. **Large data files**

You're bundling **112 MB**, which is **close to the upper edge of shinyapps.io’s free tier**. It may choke during container build or timeout during file load.

✅ **Fix**: Temporarily remove or comment out `.xlsx`, `.rds`, or `.RData` loads in your app, then deploy a minimal version. If it works, the problem is with file size or load timing.

---

### 3. **Long or blocking startup code**

If your app runs a time-consuming operation during startup (e.g., data processing, plotting, model building), the server may time out before it’s ready.

✅ **Fix**: Move heavy code into **reactive expressions** or **`observeEvent()`** so it runs **after** launch, not at startup.

---

### 4. **Missing or incompatible package**

If shinyapps.io can’t install a package or it crashes during loading, it will stall with no useful output in RStudio.

✅ **Fix**: Go to the **App Logs** in the shinyapps.io dashboard → even if you don’t see logs now, they often appear a few minutes later.

## 🧪 Immediate Diagnostic Option

Try deploying a **dummy minimal version** of your app:

1. Temporarily rename your real `app.R` → `app-real.R`
    
2. Create a new `app.R` in the same folder with just this:
