## 1. Building a bookdown

## 1A. Structure & file types
A bookdown follows a particular structure and necessitates different types of files. As follows we will detail the structure and the required specifications. 

### Multiple Rmarkdown files 

A bookdown consists of a combination of chapters. RBookdown is able to identify the chapter order because we name the files Alphanumerically. Importantly, file name must not contain spaces. 


### ".yml"  file : configuration settings
- A file of .yml extension that includes yaml code and give configuration settings for the bookdown. For now, we will call this file "_bookdown.yml". 

In it we can specify: 
- The name of the **folder where all bookdown outputs will go**. (**Impt**: This is the folder that we will use to publish the bookdown on GitPages). It it specified by "output_dir": 
	 `output_dir: "docs"`
- If we would like to keep the merged file combining all bookdown chapters: 
	 `delete_merged_file: true`
- How we will name the chapters: 
		`language:
		   `ui:
			`chapter_name: "Chapter "

All together this looks like this: 
` delete_merged_file: true
` language:
  ` ui:
    `chapter_name: "Chapter "
`output_dir: "docs"

### Index.md file: configuration settings 
*COMPLETE* !!!!!




### 1B. Render bookdown 

Once all configuration files include the desired parameters & our Rmarkdown files independently run & produce the expected ouputs, we are ready to render the bookdown. 

`install.packages("bookdown")`
`bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_dir = "docs")`

## 2. Publish the book in GitHub Pages 
### Prerequisites 
- Set-up GitHub account & download GitBash/Git for Studio
- Create empty GitHub repository for bookdown

### Link local & remote repositories & transfer files in remote repo

**In GitBash**
1.Initialize git
	`git init` 
2.Link local repository to the foreign repository in GitHub
	`git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/mybook.git 
3.Add local repository to the foreign repository 
	`git add .
3 . Commit 
	` git commit -m "Initial bookdown project"
4 . Push 
	`git push -u origin master


**In R Studio Project**
**The background steps are the same** 
		Go to **Tools > Project Options > Git/SVN** and enable Git
		 //To be detailed//!!!!!
## 3. Future versions 
## Clean and rebuild the book

- `bookdown::clean_book()
- `options(bookdown.clean_book = TRUE)` 
> To let clean_book to always work, this codeline needs to be ran. 

- `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_dir = "docs")`

- `git add .
- `git commit -m "Other Changes"
- `git push
